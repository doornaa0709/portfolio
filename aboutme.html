    <h1 style="color:white">About me:</h1>
<p style="color:white">I was born on July 9,2002 in New York. The states that I've lived in is New York, New Jersey, and Georgia.
I am going to be a sophomore at Newton High School and Newton College and Career Academy.
What I like is when I try and learn new things that I haven't done before.
What I dont like is when I give up a lot.
A fun fact about me is that I like to learn new things. When I grow up I want to be a K9 police officer or a pediatric surgeon.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Reflection:</h1>
    <p style="color:white">What I'm most proud of learning so far is how to actually make the website and putting things in it. Based on what I've learned so far, some similatities between Python and Scratch is that both programs fulfill its main purpose; coding. Python uses simple typing out on a blank document. Scratch uses variables and you are required to drop in particular varibles in specific places to make the coding work. A list is a data structure that stores data of any data type that you choose. Mys idea about robots are that they are very useful and they are good. Manuela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howard's is that they both are professors at Georgia Tech in electrical engerneering and robotics and a former NASA. What I learned about circuits that I didn't know before was what they were used for and what they mean.My favorite part of my robot's dance was when it kept going in circles one way and then stopped for a second and started going in circles the other way. </p>
