<p> Hi, my name is Amya Vannice. I was born on July 9,2002 in Long Island, New York and I was raised in Georgia. 
  I attend to Newton High School where I am going into the 10th grade.
  What I like is learning and trying out things that I have never done before. 
  What I dont like is when I don't know how to figure something out I just give up.
  A fun fact about me is that I learn quickly.</p>
